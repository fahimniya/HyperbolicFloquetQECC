## Lattices
Includes colored adjacency matrices (edges) of the lattices that honeycomb and hyperbolic Floquet codes are based on. Each lattice folder has three "*_adj_mat.txt" files for the colored (green, blue, red) edges, as well plaquettes.txt for octagonal/hexagonal plaquette data and nontriv_loops.txt for noncontractible loops of the lattices.
